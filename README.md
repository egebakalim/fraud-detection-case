# Fraud Detection – Business-Focused Case Study

This repository presents an end-to-end fraud detection case study designed from a **business and decision-making perspective**, rather than focusing solely on model performance.

The project simulates a real-world FinTech environment where fraud prevention must be balanced against customer experience, operational capacity, and revenue impact.

---

## Project Objectives
- Reduce fraud losses using data-driven risk scoring
- Minimize false positives that negatively affect legitimate customers
- Decrease dependency on manual transaction reviews
- Provide explainable insights to support risk decisions

---

## Approach Overview
The project follows a structured workflow:

1. Business problem definition and success metrics
2. Data exploration with a focus on fraud patterns and imbalance
3. Baseline rule-based detection analysis
4. Machine learning models for fraud prediction
5. Explainability and risk signal interpretation
6. Decision framework design (auto-block, review, allow)
7. Cost and business impact estimation

## Key Principles
- Business impact over model accuracy
- Explainability over black-box decisions
- Practical decision thresholds instead of theoretical metrics
- Real-world constraints such as class imbalance and operational limits

---

## Intended Audience
This project is intended for:
- Hiring managers evaluating applied data science skills
- Risk and fraud analytics teams
- Stakeholders interested in how machine learning supports business decisions
